# CAPSTONE & Projects
Showcase of the CAPSTONE project and individual projects completed for my Data Science course with Institute of Data, 20 Jul 2020 - 9 Oct 2020.

The individual projects were my first attempt to demonstrate my understanding after completion of each module of the course. 
These projects demonstrated my questioning skills (i.e. Presentation #1 and #2, Mini-Project #1 and #2), critical thinking skills (i.e. Presentation #6, #8, Mini-Project #3) and story telling skill (i.e. Presentation #3). 

The CAPSTONE project "Forecast Models" demonstrates using data to enhance the forecasting capability. Two forecast models namely Full Year Forecast and Next 28 days Forecast, were built to predict the sales performance of the retail supermarket stores using econometric approach - SARIMA. These forecast models were to aid in planning, performance monitoring and triggering timely management actions.
